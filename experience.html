            <h2>CyberSaint</h2>
            <p><strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> - May 2020 to Present</p>
            <p>Cybersaint is made up of a small yet powerful team of visionaries. Originally focused on compliance, we've diversified to stay ahead in the evolving cybersecurity landscape. As a curious engineer, I am remarkably grateful to work with a team that is as nimble, adventurous, curious, and pioneering as the one I'm currently part of. I continue to advance my skill set every day with new, innovative, and largely experimental ideas. I am the sole Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist here at Cybersaint. Over the past few years, I have developed several innovative technologies, which I will describe below. As I've discovered here, and as I will convey in this overview, even the simplest tasks can reveal complexities beyond imagination.</p>
            
            <h3>Crosswalking</h3>
            <p>In cybersecurity, crosswalking is the act of mapping one security control framework to another for the purpose of aligning regulation standards, tracking and syncing control performance, and other data movement. Historically, it involves teams of experts and an impractical amount of time performing tedious comparisons. While ideas for improvement circulate occasionally, they largely remain manual processes. A good NLP approach will eat this problem for breakfast in a matter of minutes. The issue here is data. Frameworks are wildly unique and are constantly being adapted by companies into personalized, custom frameworks. This means that the probability of overfitting on the few crosswalk datasets you can get your hands on is high. The battle to stay generalized in the broader security space is challenging, as there arenâ€™t many dedicated security datasets centered around language. Using industry standards (related controls available within popular frameworks) is a good start, but there is widespread disagreement on the accuracy of these mappings and in order to maintain a healthy training set you still need more negatively associated control pairs than positive.Some datasets exist in this regard that were born from an optimized crosswalking workflow and therefore produced intermediary language between controls, but even this is slightly misaligned as it represents a tree structure rather than a many-to-many dataset. </p>
