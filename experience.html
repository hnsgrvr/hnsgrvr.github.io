            <p><strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> - May 2020 to Present</p>
            <p>Cybersaint is made up of a small yet powerful team of visionaries. Originally focused on compliance, we've diversified to stay ahead in the evolving cybersecurity landscape. As a curious engineer, I am remarkably grateful to work with a team that is as nimble, adventurous, curious, and pioneering as the one I'm currently part of. I continue to advance my skill set every day with new, innovative, and largely experimental ideas. I am the sole Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist here at Cybersaint. Over the past few years, I have developed several innovative technologies, which I will describe below. As I've discovered here, and as I will convey in this overview, even the simplest tasks can reveal complexities beyond imagination.
